Joan Baez might well have been singing about complex systems when she lamented that "don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you got until it's gone?". And this lament is felt no more keenly on what the Patriarchy has done to women.

The patriarchy, in general, failed to understand what women are. It used their weakness against them and took their gifts by force in service of [Mammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammon). This caused the feminine energy in our society to slowly curdle and sour to the point where women are forced to be like men.

In a turn of events that would have been celebrated a century ago, the woman who chooses to not work and stay at home to raise a family is seen as a fool, and the sad fact of the matter is that any woman who places herself at the mercy of a man like this is probably a fool. The men who can support such a woman don't exist either.

If one is to be honest, we might accept that woman is the world's strongest motivating force. It is pure and raw energy, which when given to a man then inspires and directs the masculine energies to shape the world. The wise men used this energy to build their empires. The idiots thought that they had a weak, defenceless creature that would serve them and deliver them sons with which to carry on their bloodlines. And in defacing this relationship they disconnected themselves from the magic and the energy that the feminine brings to the masculine.

Take for example one of the most egregious examples of the patriarchy not understanding women --- the witch hunts. For 200 years, women were rounded up on the slightest pretext, accused of magic and burnt at the stake, a punishment so gratuitously cruel that it boggles the mind. And all this was driven by a thoroughly male institution --- the Church, and given it's first impetus by a man who clearly hated women. Celibacy had rotted his heart and driven him to such an extreme of hatred that he chose to write entire books about Witches and recruit the power of the Catholic Church in his inquisitions.

And the commonfolk often proved to be willing accomplices. The cowardice of torturing a defenceless woman and holding her responsible for this or that misfortune, it must have felt really great for it to take such a cruel turn.

The stories of what the medical profession has done to women are also legion. For centuries midwives had a birthing protocol that worked reliably. At some point male doctors decided that the superstitious old wives have no place in modern society and that men should deliver babies. And without ever studying these age old practices, male doctors dived into the vaginas of birthing women without even washing their hands which led to a huge spike in childbirth fatalities. As I said, the patriarchy mistook women's physical weakness for stupidity, their nurturing nature for weakness and began to use their wombs to populate their farms, factories and armies without giving proper respect and obesiance to the energy that made all this possible.

It was rape at a species level.

And why did the with hunts stop? Because the State became more powerful and ideas like universal human rights, due process and scientific temper became more prevalent. It can almost be said that the feminine energy from the witches found its way into politics and effeminized the entire machinery of State, which is how we got to modern versions of the state as a Nanny. Women across the world sublimated their power into State power, but in order to do so they had to remain behind as men.

Watching Blonde the other day and was struck by what industrialization did to our species. It is quite apparent that it take a village to raise a child. Extended kin networks and support groups, safe spaces, emotional regulation through community, aunts and uncles who pamper you, and so on. And then you see the kind of childhood that young Norma Jean had and the heart just breaks. A single mother, disappointed in love, blaming the young child for the loss of her love, putting such unimaginable psychic burden on that child --- none of this would have been possible without industrialisation. The single mother is a terrible social outcome and the more widespread this becomes, the worse we are failing our children and the world that we will leave for them.

When a woman is safe and loved and respected, the energy she brings is sublime and beautiful, it burns clean as a fuel and can power entire empires. And where she is burned at the stake, feminine energy recedes, leaving you with women who want to be men and where everyone has shitty sex, if they're having any at all. 

Thanks patriarchy!
