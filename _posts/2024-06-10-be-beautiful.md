Be beautiful. To yourself. To others. To the world. Be beautiful. Be you. Be the best you. Be the most beautiful you!

When you look at yourself in the mirror, you should think - what a beautiful person! When you see a photo of yourself you should think - man, so beautiful. Same for videos, portraits and so on. But how?

How to peel back the self loathing, the recriminiations, the trauma? How? Just like anything else - practice.

First of all, can you look at your enemy and say 'how beautiful this enemity! How it works to make me stronger! How it hones my craft of suffering!' ? Can you look at your heartbreak and say how beautiful this sadness, how pure my sorrow, how exquisite this arrangement of pain. Your failures? Your narrowly missed fortune? Your life? No?

Ok, then can you look at a beautiful sunrise and say - how beautiful this sunrise? Yes? Then look a little away - the tree. Beautiful? Ok, look further away. That building. Beautiful? No? Try again. See how it accentuates the wonder of the sun. Surely. That garbage can? Not beautiful? But it was made by the same forces that made the sun. It is beautiful. It is a beautiful garbage can. It is a beautiful tree. It is a beautiful sunrise. It's all beautiful.

And look at yourself. Are you beautiful? No? Come on. You were made by the same forces that made the sun. And if you don't feel beautiful it's not because of your beard or breasts or nose. It's because you don't feel worthy. So make yourself worthy. Serve others. Tell the truth. Be kind. Be generous. Be beautiful. Be you. Be the most beautiful you
