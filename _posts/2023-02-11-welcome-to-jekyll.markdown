If you're reading this it's because the present moment is calling out to you.

See how you dangle forever between the regrets of the past and the worries about the future. One story or the other, taking over your consciousness, diminishing you, keeping you small, hiding from you the glory of this present moment. Drop the stories. Come - enjoy this moment.

Wallow in the fact that you're breathing. Luxuriate in the silken caress of the air as it enters your nostril. Come alive with the excitement of the nerves as the *prana* travels down into every cell of your body, dancing the dance of the creator and giving thanks for everything, every single thing, every fucking little thing so beautiful, so big, so miraculous, so mysterious, so infinite....

Come, relax into the present moment and give thanks for all of this.

Now. Here. This.
